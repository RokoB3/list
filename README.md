I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
var x = 0;
alert(x);
```


- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
